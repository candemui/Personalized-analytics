This documentation was developed for confidential projects, so it may be adapted to eliminate private and secured information in order to comply with the law. (Ley 25.326).
These documents were created considering the corresponding legislation for each entity depending on the legal system of the jurisdiction in which they carry out their activities.
The applicable law may vary throughout the national territory and also for foreign entities.
The document has a dashboard that supports the information for a better understanding of the subject. Due to confidentiality, I cannot share the dashboard with its database, so I am attaching a PowerPoint, painting in black all the logos or company names that may appear.
